# **Networks and Volumes**

  

- Becomes important when we have multiple containers

- To Allow containers to talk to eachother we need Networks

- If you are running a database to store data and stop the container the data goes away

to solve this we need Volumes


```

Backend container

|

|[NETWORKS]

|

Database Container (mongo)

|

|

[VOLUMES]

```

  

---

# **Volumes :**

  

- Volumes helps you store the data in the database container even if the database container crashes or removed

  

## Step-1: **Create a volume**

```bash
docker volume create volume_database
```

- Can view volumes `Docker volume ls `

## Step-2: **Mount**

- Mount the Volume to the database

```bash

docker run -v volume_database:/data/db -p 27017:27017

```

- `-v` stands for volume

- `volume_database:/data/db` - Here we are connecting the volume to the location where the database stores the data
- here 27017 is the port of mongodb
- mongo stores the data in `/data/db` inside the container ` it will be different for every database `

---

# **Networks**

- In docker Networks allows us to communicate with other containers

- Docker containers cant talk to each other by default

- for `example :` we have two containers one with nodejs (backend ) and other with mongodb (database) then they cant communicate to each other

```

Backend Database

| |

| |

| |[port:27017]

[DB Port:27017]

```

- Here Both the ports are different They are connecting to the `ports of the container` not to the `Host machine Ports`

  

## Step-1: **Create Network**

```bash

docker network create my_custom_network

```

- It Creates a Network

- We can view Networks using ` docker network ls`

  

## Step-2: **Connect DB to Network**

  

- We can connect the Db to network using `--network ` tag and give it a name using `--name `

  

```bash

docker run -d --network my_custom_network --name mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo

```

  

- Here the database is connected to the network but the backend did not

  

- To connect change the database url from `mongodb://localhost:27017/mydb` to `mongodb://<Container_name>:27017/mydb` ie `mongodb://mongo:27017/mydb`

---

## We can see the logs of the container by

`docker logs <container id> `
