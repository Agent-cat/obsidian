# Docker File

---

- `DockerFile` is written in the repository to containerise the app

```Dockerfile

# Base Image
FROM node:16-alpine

# Working Directory Where the code will be placed in container
WORKDIR /app

# COPY code fron local to container
COPY . .

# RUN is used to Setup the Project in container
RUN npm install

RUN npx prisma grnerate

RUN npm run build

# EXPOSE is used to expose the port
EXPOSE 3000

# CMD is used to run the app it is used whed we type docker run
CMD [ "node","/dist/index.js" ]

```

  

- Some other commands

- `ENV` - Sets the environment variable

  

### Add a `.dockerignore` file

  

- when we run ` COPY . .` it will copy `node_modules` also so we should make a `.dockerignore` file to ignore coppying them

  

---

## Step-2: ` After writing Dockerfile`

  

- After writing Dockerfile we should build it

  

```bash
docker build -t <Imagename> .
```

- Here `-t` is the tage `ie:` name

- `.` is where Docker can find `Dockerfile`

---

## Step-3 : `After Building your Docker image is ready `

  

- You can run it by typing

```bash
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 <Imagename>
```

---

## Step-4: `How to add ENV`

  

- while running the container add a `-e` tag to add an env

```bash
docker run -d -e DATABASE_URL="..." -p 3000:3000 backend
```

- Here `-e` stands for environment variable

---

## Step-5: `Layers in Docker`

- Every step in docker file is a layer

- Docker will cache each layer

- If one layer is changed then it runs the below layers again

```Dockerfile

FROM node:16-alpine

  

WORKDIR /app

  

# Here if any thing in code changes it re runs the entire layers below it

COPY . .

RUN npm install

RUN npx prisma grnerate

RUN npm run build

  

EXPOSE 3000

  

CMD [ "node","/dist/index.js" ]

```

- But `npm install` and `npx prisma generate ` sholud only re run if package.json and prisma changs but we are running them even they are not changed this is not a good practise

  

```Dockerfile
# Use a slim and stable Node.js base image
FROM node:16-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies early to cache the layer
COPY package*.json ./
COPY prisma ./prisma/


RUN npx prisma generate

# Copy all source code after dependencies are installed
COPY . .

# Build the app
RUN npm run build

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start the app
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]


```

- Here we will run these steps only when package.json or prisma changes

- This will reduce the build time of the image

- `package*`- any file which starts with package as name

> Here if the code changes it will just re run the last 2 layers
