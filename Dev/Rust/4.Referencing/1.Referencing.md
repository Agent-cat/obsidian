```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("Vishnu");
    let s2 = &s1;
    println!(" s1: {}, s2: {}", s1, s2);
}
```
- Here we are passing the reference of s1 insted of borrowing the ownership 
- So we can use both s1 and s2 
- References are im mutable by default 
- So there are mutable references which is denoted by & mut
