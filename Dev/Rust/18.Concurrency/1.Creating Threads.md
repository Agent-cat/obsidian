## How to spawn a thread 
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..1000 {
            println!(" hi fron thread msg= {i}")
        }
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(30));
    });
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("from main thread {i}");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
    }
}
```
- in the avove example both the main thread and spawn thread runs simultaneously so we get results randomly

### How to wait for a thread to complete `.join()`
- we use .join() fn to stop execution of remaining part until the current thread is completed execution 
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
fn main() {
    let thread1 = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!(" hi fron thread msg= {i}")
        }
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(30));
    });
    thread1.join();

    // this will not execute the main thread untill the spawn thread completed execution 
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("from main thread {i}");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(10));
    }
}

```
- This will not execute the main thread untill the spawn thread completed execution

## `move ` keyword
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    {
        let vec = vec![1, 2, 34, 4];
        let thread1 = thread::spawn(|| print!("{:?}", vec));
        //we will get an error because we dont know when will the thread start exexution if it prints x then it goes out of scope and becomes dangling pointer 
    }
    print!("{x}");
}
```
- we will get an error because we dont know when will the thread start exexution if it prints x then it goes out of scope and becomes dangling pointer
- so we use move keyword here we are transfering the ownership to the thread 
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;
fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    {
        let vec = vec![1, 2, 34, 4];
        let thread1 = thread::spawn(move|| print!("{:?}", vec));
        //move is uder to transfer thr ownership
        
    }
    print!("{x}");
}
```
