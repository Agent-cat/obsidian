```rust
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..100 {
            println!("Hi No :{i} from Spawn Thread");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Hi No :{i} from main Thread");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
}

```
- Here the main thread executed fastly so the spawn thread is also stoped we can avoid it using join
##`Join`
```rust
use std::{thread, time::Duration};
fn main() {
    let thread1 = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..100 {
            println!("Hi No :{i} from Spawn Thread");
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
        }
    });
    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Hi No :{i} from main Thread");
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1));
    }
    thread1.join().expect("Thread crashed ");
}
//Here the main thread executed fastly so the spawn thread is also stoped we can avoid it using join
```
