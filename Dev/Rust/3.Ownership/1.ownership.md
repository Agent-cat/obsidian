- Rust use ownership model to manage memory insted of garbage collector

- Since it is not using Garbage collector it is fast

- It says Each data should have a single owner if the owner dies the data also dies

- Same like Rihana and her boyfriends (Kirath's Example )

  

---

  

## `Rules`

  

- Each value has a variable that is called Owner

- Their can only be one owner at a time

- If the owner goes out of scope the variable will be droped

# Mutability

  

[Reference](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/rust-bootcamp/Rust-Bootcamp-11)

  

- Immutable variables represent variables whose value cant be changed once assigned

  

```rust

fn main() {

let x: i8 = 1;

x = 2; // Error because x is immutable

println!("{}", x);

}

```

  

- By default, all variables in Rust are immutable because

- Immutable data is inherently thread-safe because if no thread can alter the data, then no synchronization is needed when data is accessed concurrently.

  

```rust

fn main() {

let mut x: i32 = 1;

x = 2; // No error

println!("{}", x);

}

```

# Stack vs Heap

  

[Reference](https://projects.100xdevs.com/tracks/rust-bootcamp/Rust-Bootcamp-12)

  

- we store the variables whose size can be pridected `ex:` `int` , `bool`

- we store variables whose size can not be pridected and store the memory location in stack and actually store them in heap `ex:` `Strings`, `vectors` , `arrays` etc..

  

---

  

- When you assign a value from one variable to another, the ownership can shift.

  

```rust

let s1 = String::from("hello");

let s2 = s1; // Ownership passes from s1 to s2

  

println!("{}", s2); // "hello"

// println!("{}", s1); // This would error because s1 can no longer be used

```

  

- Not all data types in Rust have strict ownership Rules

- Simple types, like integers, are copied instead of having their ownership transferred: as they are stored in stack

  

```rust

let num1 = 5;

let num2 = num1; // num1 is copied, not transferred

  

println!("{}", num1); // 5, Totally valid!

println!("{}", num2); // 5, Also valid!

```
