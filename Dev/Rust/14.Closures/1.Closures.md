- Closures are same as functions but can be stored in a variable 
- It is like arrow functions 
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = |x: i32| -> i32 { 2 };
    x(10);
    x(20);
}
```
## `OR`
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = |x: i32| -> i32  2 ;
    // we can remove {} if it is only one line 
    x(10);
    x(20);
}
```
