- we use patterns in match expressions
---
- `Type-1`
```rust
fn main() {
    // It is like switch case 
    let x = 3;
    match x {
        1|3 => println!("One"),// | is a or operator
        2..5 => println!("Two"),
        _ => println!("uncompatable"),
    }
}
```
---
- `Type-2`
```rust
fn main() {
    let x = Some(5);
    match x {
        Some(x) => print!("{}", x),
        None => print!("None"),
    }
}

```
