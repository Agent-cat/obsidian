- We can handle errors by pattern matching using Result enum

```rust
fn main(){
    enum Result<T,E>{
        Ok(T),
        Err(E),

    }
}
```
- We can handle erroes in two types 
    - By pattern matching the result enum 
    - By using unwrap and expect methods
- `By pattern matching`
```rust
use std::fs::File;
fn main() {
    let f = File::open("index.tsx");
    match f {
        Ok(t) => print!("{:?}", t),
        Err(e) => print!("{}", e),
    }
}

```    
- `By using unwrap and expect`
```rust
use std::fs::File;
fn main() {
    let f = File::open("index.tsx").unwrap();
    // if we use unwrap the thread will panic because we did not handled the err
    let f = File::open("index.tsx").expect("faild tomopen the file");
    // By expect we are handeling the error
}

```
