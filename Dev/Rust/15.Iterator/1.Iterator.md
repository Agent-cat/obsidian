# Iterators 
---
- Iterators are used to iterate over items same as java 

## `Method-1`
```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![20, 30, 12, 6];
    let mut iter = vec.iter();
    while let Some(val) = iter.next() {
        println!("{}", val)
    }
}
```
## `Method-2`
- If we use normal for loop it takes the ownership and we cant use the previous owner again so we use iterators
```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![20, 30, 12, 6];
    let iter = vec.iter();
    // makes a copy does not takes the ownership
    for item in iter {
        print!("{}", item);
    }
    print!("{:?}", vec)
    // Here we can use the vec again we are not transfering the owner ship
}

```
# There are multiple types of Iterators please refer the slides 
---
## `Consuming adaptors`
- Methods that call next are called consuming adaptors, because calling them uses up the iterato

```rust
fn main() {
    let vec = vec![2, 3, 5, 6];
    let iter1 = vec.iter(); //Here iter1 is the consuming adaptor 
    let sum: i32 = iter1.sum();
    print!("{}", sum);
    // print!("{}", iter1.sum()) //we can not use it again because it is consumed
}

```
---
## `Iterator adaptor`
- Iterator adaptors are methods deﬁned on the Iterator trait that don’t consume the 
iterator. Instead, they produce diﬀerent iterators by changing some aspect of the 
original iterato
    - `map`
    - `filter`
```rust
fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];
    let v1_iter = v1.iter();
   // It takes a closure 
    let vl_iter2 = v1_iter.map(|y| y + 1);
   // Here it does not takes Consumes the V1_iter It creates new Iterator and returns it 
    for item in vl_iter2 {
        println!("{}", item);
    }
}
```
```rust
fn main() {
    let v1 = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];
    let v1_iter = v1.iter();
    //It takes a closure
    let vl_iter2 = v1_iter.filter(|y| *y % 2 == 0);
    // Here it does not takes Consumes the V1_iter It creates new Iterator and returns it
    // It filters out only even
    for item in vl_iter2 {
        println!("{}", item);
    }
}
```
