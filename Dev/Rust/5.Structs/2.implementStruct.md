# Struct implementation 
```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // This is debug trait
struct Rectangle {
    width: i32,
    height: i32,
}
fn main() {
    let dimensions = Rectangle {
        width: 20,
        height: 40,
    };
    let area: i32 = caldimension(&dimensions);
    print!("The area of Rectangle is : {}", area);
    print!(" dimensions : {:?}", dimensions); // we need to implement debug trait to print structs
}
fn caldimension(dimension: &Rectangle) -> i32 {
    dimension.height * dimension.width
}
```
- Here insted of writing the caldimension function we can impl the struct
- they are like methods
```rust
#[derive(Debug)] // This is debug trait
struct Rectangle {
    width: i32,
    height: i32,
}
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> i32 {
        self.height * self.width
    }
}
fn main() {
    let dimensions = Rectangle {
        width: 20,
        height: 40,
    };
    let area: i32 = dimensions.area();
    print!("The area of Rectangle is : {}", area);
    print!(" dimensions : {:?}", dimensions); // we need to implement debug trait to print structs
}
```
- By this we can know that the area fn is associated with rectangle struct
