- We can declare function with `fn` keyword

  

```rust

fn main (){

greet();

}

fn greet(){

println!("Hi");

}

```

  

- We can pass argmunts and return the values from function

  

```rust

fn main (){

greet(a:i32,b:i32);

}

fn add(num1:i32 ,num2:132)->i32 //return type

{

num1+num2 //No need to type return if we dont add ; at end

}

```

## Return behavior

  

- In Rust, a function's last expression is automatically its returned value, as long as it's not followed by a semicolon.

  

- For example, the following function returns the square of a number.

  

```rust

fn square(x: i32) -> i32 {

x * x

}

  

let result = square(3);

println!(result); // 9

```
