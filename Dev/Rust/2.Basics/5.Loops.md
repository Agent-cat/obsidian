# Loops

  

```rust

fn main() {

let a =[10,20,30,40,50];

// Control Flow

loop{

println!("This prints infinitely until we call break")

}

  
  

// For Loop

// Here .iter() is an iterator it executes the loop without takin the ownership of the array

for i in a.iter(){

println!("{i}");

}

  

// We can loop through a range

// It prints 5 times

// Exclusive ranges (..) include the start value, but exclude the end value.

for i in 1..6 {

print!("{ }", i);

}

}

```

  

---

  

- Inclusive ranges (..=) include both the start and end values.

  

```rust

// Using inclusive range (..=)

for inclusive_num in 1..=3 {

// This loop iterates over values 1, 2, and 3.

println!("Inclusive count: {}", inclusive_num);

}

```
